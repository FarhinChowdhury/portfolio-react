                                    Welcome! It’s Farhin here. 
                                    <br/><br/>
                                    My topsy turvy career path along can speak to my new found interest for coding in 2020. Lost yet hopeful, I joined a coding bootcamp in the Fall to find myself unravelling into the exciting world of code and started to imagine the life of a full stack developer. 
                                    <br/><br/>

                                    Perhaps the number of interconnected steps, strokes and commands resonate with my love for dancing from a very young age. Stemming from dance lessons since the age of five I rarely get to practice my passion anymore, but that doesn’t stop me from swinging around my home whenever I need to clear my mind. 

                                    <br/><br/>
                                    When I am not dancing or thinking of coding my way out of the life, I prefer boarding a plane,and when that’s out of the picture I’ll indulge in animated movies and cooking up a storm at home. 

                                    <br/><br/>
                                    Unlike the other places my career has taken me, this new space makes me feel like I belong. The lustre of the front end and the investigations in the backend keep me wired to learn more. It also makes me wonder why I didn’t take it up seriously in my earlier years. 

                                    I invite you to a small portfolio that continues to grow, a linked profile calling for our connection and a GitHub page that makes you come back.
